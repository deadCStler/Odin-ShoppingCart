Things pending to do:

- Search
  - ~~we will click on the search icon and it will convert to a bar and then you search~~
  - ~~there is no search so we will get all the products and then display it only if it contains that text~~
    - can add filters also to sort by price or different category
    - make remove filter also to go back to original one
  - if no the no prod found page
- Loading pages for Prod Page, ItemsPage
- Update Banner Links

Bugs to address:

- Closing of Nav menu when rendering another page.
  - Idea is to use locator in useEffect
- Item number in cart svg at top not updating
  - try using a state
- Even if it is not logged it is adding in cart
